# Issue Tracker

## Tracker Rules

- Add new items when feature work uncovers a suspected bug, stale doc, test
  smell, performance anomaly, or correctness risk.
- Keep each item scoped tightly enough to fix and verify independently.
- Record the date on the item, not in this filename.
- Move an item to `Resolved Issues` only after the fix has tests or documented
  verification evidence.
- Do not use this tracker as a substitute for tests, benchmarks, or release
  notes.
- Performance issues should stay in
  [`benchmark-signal-hardening-backlog.md`](benchmark-signal-hardening-backlog.md)
  unless they become a confirmed runtime defect. Do not add performance issues
  here until they have been investigated and confirmed as runtime defects.

## Active Issues

## Resolved Issues

### 3D Direct Collider Inactive Load Preserved Stale Partition State

**Discovered:** 2026-07-06  
**Resolved:** 2026-07-06  
**Source:** Coverage Roadmap E review and 2D/3D serialization parity audit  
**Affected area:** `LSCollider.RecordData(...)`, 3D bodyless collider
serialization, primary and mixed partition state cleanup

RCA: 3D direct-collider serialization correctly wrote and loaded
`Active=false`, but the inactive load branch only removed the collider from the
partition services. It did not mark the collider's own primary/mixed partition
state unpartitioned or clear cached coordinates. The matching 2D path already
cleared service membership and collider-local partition state, so 3D could
remain inactive while still reporting stale partition membership.

Fix: `LSCollider.ApplyLoadedState()` now clears collider-local primary and
mixed partition state after loading inactive collider state.

Verification:

- Added a 3D parity regression for inactive bodyless collider population.
- Verified the new regression failed before the fix and passed after the fix.
- Ran focused 2D/3D serialization tests.
- Ran full `Release`, full `ReleaseLean`, coverage collection, and
  `git diff --check`.

### Mixed Discrete Response Can Reverse Restitution-Heavy Kinematic CCD Handoff Velocity

**Discovered:** 2026-06-23  
**Resolved:** 2026-06-25  
**Source:** CCD service-level island solver validation  
**Affected area:** `CollisionResponseMixed`, mixed CCD handoff tests,
`GravitasMixedCollisionService` full-frame response ordering

RCA: the isolated pure-service CCD handoff was correct, but the later full-frame
mixed discrete response read kinematic participants through stored dynamic
`LinearVelocity`. Kinematic bodies keep that velocity at zero and expose their
deterministic host movement through the current continuous-collision frame
displacement instead. With restitution enabled, the same-frame mixed response
therefore compared a fast handed-off 3D target against a seemingly stationary 2D
source and could apply a backward bounce.

Fix: `CollisionResponseMixed` now resolves kinematic participants through their
current frame displacement velocity while still treating them as infinite-mass
participants for impulse application.

Verification:

- Added full-frame mixed regression coverage for a kinematic 2D source crossing
  a dynamic 3D target with restitution enabled.
- Verified existing symmetric kinematic mixed-source cases.
- Ran the mixed-dimension test suite.
